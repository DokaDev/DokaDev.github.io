## What is Git?
Git is distributed version control system used in software development for tracking changes in source code during software development.
It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel.
The key features of Git include speed, performance suitable for large-scale projects, and strong support for distributed environments.

## Key Features of Git
* **Version Control**: Tracks the history of changes to files, allowing you to see what changes were made and when.
* **Distributed Development**: Works with complete local copies of a repository, enabling work to continue regardless of network status.
* **Branching**: Provides independent workspaces for different features or bug fixes, facilitating efficient teamwork.
* **Merging**: Allows for the easy integration of developed features from different branches into the main code.

## Core Concepts of Git
* **Repository**: The place where all version information and history of a project is stored.
* **Commit**: The act of recording changes to files or directories in the repository. Each commit has a unique ID that represents a snapshot at a specific point in time.
* **Branch**: An independent workspace created from the existing code to work on new features or bug fixes in isolation.
* **Merge**: The process of combining the development made in one branch back into the main branch.
<!-- * **Tag**: Naming a specific commit for easy reference, often used for version releases.

## Basic Usage of Git
1. **Installing Git**: First, you need to install Git. You can download and install it from the official website for your operating system.
2. **Initializing a Repository**: Run the `git init` command in your project folder to initialize a Git repository.
3. **Committing Changes**: After modifying or adding files, use the `git add` command to add them to the staging area, and then `git commit` to create a commit and record the changes in the repository.
4. **Branch Management**: Use the `git branch` command to create a new branch, and `git checkout` to switch between branches.
5. **Remote Repositories**: Add a remote repository with `git remote and origin [remote repository URL]` and upload local repository changes to the remote repository with `git push`.
