In a 2D Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at the center, two circles of different sizes are given. When two integers `r1` and `r2` representing the radii are provided as parameters, complete the solution functions to return the number of points with both x and y coordinates as integers that lie in the space between the two circles.

â€» Points on the circles are also included in the count



#### Constraints
$1 \le r1 \le r2 \le 1,000,000$



#### I/O Example

| r1   | r2   | result |
| ---- | ---- | ------ |
| 2    | 3    | 20     |

As shown in the illustration, there are a total of 20 points with integer pairs.



##### C++

```c++
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

long long solution(int r1, int r2) {
    // Initialize the answer to count points on the y-axis that lie between r1 and r2
    // This includes points within and on the boundary of the two circles along the y-axis.
    long long result = r2 - r1 + 1;
    
    long long rr1 = static_cast<long long>(r1) * r1;
    long long rr2 = static_cast<long long>(r2) * r2;

    // Loop through each x-coordinate from 1 to r2 (not including 0 as it's already counted)
    for (int x = 1; x < r2; x++) { 
        long long xx = static_cast<long long>(x) * x;
        int maxY = static_cast<int>(sqrt(rr2 - xx));

        if (x < r1) { // If x is within the smaller circle
            int minY = static_cast<int>(ceil(sqrt(rr1 - xx)));
            result += maxY - minY + 1;
        } else result += maxY; // If x is outside the smaller circle
    }
    return result * 4;
}
```
